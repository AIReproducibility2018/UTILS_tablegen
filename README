Note: The release version of this repository that was referenced from the
thesis of NN did not include the raw list of problems, assumptions, etc
that were encountered for each specific paper covered. The version of this
list as it was on 2018.06.14 is included in commit 89c4fe44b45fc8983cf5de527fd7305f6186260b ,
which was commited two days after the original release version.

A release version v1.1 has been made to make this more visible.


Generates figures for various categories (problem, assumption, error), and
stores then in the directory output_figures/

TODO:
* include exact version numbers and requirements
* Remove unused code (e.g PIL ?)
